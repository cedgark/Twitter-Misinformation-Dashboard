# Twitter-Misinformation-Dashboard
 For my Cardiff University  group project, our aim was to create a dashboard system that essentially helps users track and identify misinformation spreading on social media sites such as Twitter. In recent years, misinformation has become a major problem in social networks. We have seen how the spreading of misinformation can have significant negative effects on public health (e.g., false anti-vaccination rumours), the political process (e.g., deterring people from voting), and security (e.g., vandalism of 5G transmitters due to false Coronavirus-related rumours). Detecting and tracking misinformation on social media has become an important task; the sheer scale of networks such as Twitter and Reddit means that this cannot be done entirely manually by humans - software support is required. The goal of this project is therefore to create a “dashboard system” to assist people tasked with detecting and tracking misinformation. The system required at least three parts: (1) facilities to collect data from social media, ideally in real-time, (2) techniques to analyse the collected data and reveal patterns, trends, and topics, and (3) visualisations to present the results of the analyses to users to help them understand misinformation activities.
